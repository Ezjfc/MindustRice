Hi,
my name is Endermanbugzjfc.

I am currently working on this Mindustry RICE
(Race Inspired Cosmetic Enhancement) of Linux.

At this moment,
I have animated the
- battery display
- memory display
- power profiles switcher
- idle inhibitor

These animations were implemented in GTK JavaScript
and GTK CSS.

Although they are not identical to those in-game,
I have made every effort to mimic them.

I hope you will love this project
and I will appreciate your suggestions.

See you.
