## Project Status

- Although being staled for 4 months after October 2025, this project is expected to receive more progress gradually in 2026.
- It currently favours laptops but support for desktop will be added.
- It currently favours NixOS but it should work for other distros when the Nix package manager is setup correctly and preferably with Home Manager installed.
- It currently does not support operating systems outside of Linux but I wish it could.
